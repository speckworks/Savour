<h1>Savour</h1>
<h4>Mock of a popular craft beer ordering application. This is for DEMO-PURPOSE ONLY.</h4> 

**We have no intention of commercializing this app at this point, we simply want to show our enthusiasm for another React Native Product with a similar name (and maybe become contenders for a position on their team).**

<ul>

<li>
"yarn install" 
 </li>
<br>
<li>
"expo start" from Command Line runs the App.  If you have Expo App downloaded on your phone, you can grab a QR code in the console and start up the app on your phone.  Otherwise, run the app in the web browser.  
 </li>
 <li>
For server, CD into server folder, then "node src/index.js"
</li>
</ul>
<br>
  <span>
I recommend starting with the web view, but if you are able to add the Expo App in your mobile device(iOS or Android), it will allow you to Scan the QR code from the console window of your local host browser and open the app on your phone.
